Image Encryption and Decryption Tool
This project provides a simple way to encrypt and decrypt images using pixel manipulation techniques. It leverages Python's Pillow library to perform operations on image data.

Features
Pixel Swapping: Randomly swaps pixels in the image to obscure the original content.
Brightness Adjustment: Modifies the brightness of the image by adding a constant value to each pixel's RGB values.
Encryption/Decryption: Combines pixel swapping and brightness adjustment to securely encrypt and decrypt images.
